# Constructing-Milky-Way-Dust-Map



This repository contains a Python project for constructing a dust map of the Milky Way using RR Lyrae stars identified in the Gaia DR3 catalog. The project employs Gaia data to analyze the light curves of RR Lyrae stars, estimate their periods, mean magnitudes, and use this information to map interstellar dust.
